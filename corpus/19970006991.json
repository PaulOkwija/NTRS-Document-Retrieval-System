This included: development of viscoplastic continuum models, associated numerical integration techniques, suitable micromechanics models/methods, and coupled deformation and damage algorithms. The work was involved with models/methods applicable to composite structures on both microscale and macroscale levels. The microscale analysis utilized Aboudi's generalized method of cells (GMS) micromechanical model as well as finite element models of similar composite architectures, i.e., square and hexagonal fiber pack models.", "keywords": ["lightweight structural elements", "structural fatigue", "weight analysis", "dynamic structural analysis", "structural analysis"]}
