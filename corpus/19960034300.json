In the present design a plurality of thermo-electric heat pumps are used to couple a source plate to a sink plate. Each heat pump is individually controlled by a model based controller. The controller coordinates the heat pumps to maintain isothermality in the source.", "keywords": ["electric energy conversion devices", "microwave energy conversion devices", "chemical energy conversion devices", "geophysical energy conversion devices", "hybrid energy conversion devices"]}
