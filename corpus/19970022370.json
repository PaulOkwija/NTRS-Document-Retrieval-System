    "abstract": "Research into processing techniques for fabrication of vacuum microelectronic devices has been carried out, with special emphasis being given to the growth of silicon dioxide thin films. Oxide films ranging from 30 nm to approximately 2 micrometers have been grown on single crystal silicon wafers. Metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor test structures have been made from some of these oxide films, and current-versus-voltage plots for these structures have been measured. It has been observed that the rate of applied voltage across the oxide films produces marked differences in measured leakage current. Breakdown fields across two of the thinnest oxide films have been measured and are comparable with highest values reported in literature. Several silicon wafers were processed to make field- emitter array diodes, and were delivered to collaborators at NASA-Lewis Research Center for final fabrication steps and testing."
