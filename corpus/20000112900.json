A thermal energy conservation equation was derived from first principles. An electrochemical and thermal coupled model was created by the addition of this equation to an existing multiphase, electrochemical model. Charging at various rates was investigated and the results validated against experimental data. Reaction currents, pressure changes, temperature profiles, and concentration variations within the cell are predicted numerically and compared with available data and theory.", "keywords": ["magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) energy conversion device", "energy production", "energy storage", "microwave energy transmission", "alternative energy sources"]}
