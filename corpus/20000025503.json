The substrate comprises pure nickel metal or a nickel-containing metal alloy such as stainless steel having a highly polished reflective surface. The coating is a layer of silver deposited on the substrate to a thickness of 300 A to 3000 A. A 300 A to 5000 A protective coating of silica, alumina or magnesium fluoride is used to cover the silver and to protect it from oxidation. The combination is useful as a parabolic shaped secondary concentrator for collecting solar radiation for generating power or thermal energy for satellite uses. The reflective layer and protective coating preferably are applied to the reflective surface of the substrate by electron beam evaporation or by ion sputtering.", "keywords": ["solar generators", "solar heating (space applications)", "solar power (space applications)", "solar panels (energy conversion)", "solar cells (energy conversion)"]}
