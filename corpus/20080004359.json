{"id": 20080004359, "subjectCategory": "Optics", "title": "System for determining position of normal shock in supersonic flow", "abstract": "Light from a plurality of light emitting diodes is transmitted through optical cables (12) to a lens system. The lenses (56, 58) expand and collimate the light and project it in a sheet (16) across the supersonic inlet of an aircraft power plant perpendicular to incoming airflow. A normal shock bends a portion of the sheet of light (16). A linear array of a multiplicity of optical fiber ends collects discrete samples of light. The samples are processed and compared to a predetermined profile to determine the shock location.", "keywords": ["coherent light", "light absorption", "light reflection", "light scattering", "light transmission"]}
