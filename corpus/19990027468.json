    "title": "On-Wafer Characterization of Millimeter-Wave Antennas for Wireless Applications",
    "abstract": "The paper demonstrates a de-embedding technique and a direct on-substrate measurement technique for fast and inexpensive characterization of miniature antennas for wireless applications at millimeter-wave frequencies. The technique is demonstrated by measurements on a tapered slot antenna (TSA). The measured results at Ka-Band frequencies include input impedance, mutual coupling between two TSAs and absolute gain of TSA."
