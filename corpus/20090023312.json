The purpose of this report is to inform the Advisory Commit tee on Reactor Safeguards of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission in re gard to the design of the reactor facility, the cha,acteristics of th e site, and the hazards of operation at this location, The purpose o  f this reactor is to perform critical experiments, to measure reactiv ity effects, to serve as a neutron source, and to serve as a training  tool. The reactor facility is described. This is followed by a discu ssion of the nuclear characteristics and the control system. Site cha racteristics are then discussed followed by a discussion of the exper iments which may be conducted in the facility. The potential hazards  of the facility are then considered, particularly, the maximum credib le accident. Finally, the administrative procedure is discussed.", "keywords": ["reactor theory", "nuclear reactor theory", "reactor radiation safety measures (space applications)", "nuclear decay", "nuclear fission"]}
