{"id": 19960014856, "subjectCategory": "Optics", "title": "Fiber-Optic Based Compact Gas Leak Detection System", "abstract": "A propellant leak detection system based on Raman scattering principles is introduced. The proposed system is flexible and versatile as the result of the use of optical fibers. It is shown that multiple species can be monitored simultaneously. In this paper oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen are detected and monitored. The current detection sensitivity for both hydrogen and carbon monoxide is 1% partial pressure at ambient conditions. The sensitivity for oxygen and nitrogen is 0.5% partial pressure. The response time to changes in species concentration is three minutes. This system can be used to monitor multiple species at several locations.", "keywords": ["coherent light", "light absorption", "light reflection", "light scattering", "light transmission"]}
