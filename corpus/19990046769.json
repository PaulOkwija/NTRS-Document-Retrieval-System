    "title": "Method and Apparatus for Testing Microwave Devices and Circuits in a Controlled Environment",
    "abstract": "A test system is disclosed that enables the testing of microwave components in a controlled environment without disturbing that environment. The system includes a test fixture which holds the calibration standards and the component being tested, and environmental control chamber, and a microwave switching system. The system provides a coaxial connection to microwave testing equipment, such as an automatic network analyzer (ANA) and facilitates both calibration and testing while maintaining environmental integrity."
