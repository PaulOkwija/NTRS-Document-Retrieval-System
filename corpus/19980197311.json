    "title": "Linearly Tapered Slot Antenna Radiation Characteristics at Millimeter-Wave Frequencies",
    "abstract": "An endfire travelling wave antenna, such as, a linearly tapered slot antenna (LTSA) is a viable alternative to a patch antenna at millimeter-wave frequencies because of its simple design and ease of fabrication. This paper presents the radiation characteristics of LTSA at higher millimeter-wave frequencies. The measured radiation patterns are observed to be well behaved and symmetric with the main beam in the endfire direction. The measured gain is about 10 dB. The LTSAs have potential wireless applications at 50 GHz, 77 GHz, and 94 GHz."
