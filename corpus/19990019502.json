The interoperation of the forecast models on these geographically diverse, high performance Cray platforms required the transfer of large three dimensional data sets at very high information rates. High capacity, terrestrial fiber optic transmission system technologies were integrated with those of an experimental high speed communications satellite in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) to test the integration of the two systems. Operation over a spacecraft in GEO orbit required modification of the standard configuration of legacy data communications protocols to facilitate their ability to perform efficiently in the changing environment characteristic of a hybrid network. The success of this performance tuning enabled the use of such an architecture to facilitate high data rate, fiber optic quality data communications between high performance systems not accessible to standard terrestrial fiber transmission systems. Thus obviating the performance degradation often found in contemporary earth/satellite hybrids.", "keywords": ["atmospheric physics", "atmospheric electricity", "atmospheric optics", "atmospheric scattering", "atmospheric radiation"]}
