Daily and 30-day average noise estimates are reduced by, almost 50% and 35%, respectively, by analyzing and adjusting (if necessary) for errors due to (1) missing data, (2) residual harmonics of the annual cycle unique to particular satellites, (3) lack of filtering, and (4) spurious trends. After adjustments, the decadal trend of the lower-tropospheric global temperature from January 1979 through February 1994 becomes -0.058 C, or about 0.03 C per decade cooler than previously calculated.", "keywords": ["gravitational anomalies (terrestrial)", "gravitational theory (terrestrial)", "gravitational waves (terrestrial)", "magnetism (terrestrial)", "hydrosphere studies"]}
