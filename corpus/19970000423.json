{"id": 19970000423, "subjectCategory": "Optics", "title": "Dynamic Light Scattering From Colloidal Gels", "abstract": "We present a brief, preliminary account of the interpretation of dynamic light scattering from fractal colloidal gels. For small scattering angles, and for high initial colloid particle volume fractions, the correlation functions exhibit arrested decay, reflecting the non-ergodic nature of these systems and allowing us to directly determine the elastic modulus of the gels. For smaller initial volume fractions, the correlation functions decay completely. In all cases, the initial decay is not exponential, but is instead described by a stretched exponential. We summarize the principles of a model that accounts for these data and discuss the scaling behavior of the measured parameters.", "keywords": ["coherent light", "light absorption", "light reflection", "light scattering", "light transmission"]}
