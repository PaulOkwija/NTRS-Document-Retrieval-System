Regenerative fuel cell systems have been suggested for future manned space missions, but to meet the needed specific power requirements substantial improvements in the state-of-the-art technologies are needed. Similar improvements are needed, with emphasis on cost reduction in addition to higher conversion efficiency, for fuel cell systems that have potential for terrestrial applications. Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells have been identified as promising candidates for development that would lead to the desired cost reduction and increased efficiency.", "keywords": ["chemical energy conversion devices", "geophysical energy conversion devices", "hybrid energy conversion devices", "photovoltaic energy conversion devices", "thermionic energy conversion devices"]}
