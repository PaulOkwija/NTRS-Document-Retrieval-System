    "title": "Micro-Coplanar Striplines: New Transmission Media for Microwave Applications",
    "abstract": "In this paper a new transmission line for microwave applications, referred to here as the Micro-Coplanar Stripline (MCPS), is introduced. The propagation characteristics, such as, characteristic impedance (Z(sub 0) and effective dielectric constant (epsilon eff) for a range of MCPS geometries have been modeled using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Technique and presented here. Also, preliminary experimental results on the performance of an MCP-Microstrip transition and an MCPS-fed patch antenna are presented. The results indicate several potential applications of the MCPS line in microwave integrated circuit technology."
