The sensor is fabricated so as to include a Fabry-Perot gap formed between the ends of two mated optical fibers. By examining the optical characteristics of light that is transmitted through the Fabry-Perot sensor gap, an indication of gap width can be ascertained. Accordingly, a change in Fabry-Perot sensor gap width is related to a change in the particular physical parameter to be measured. In another embodiment of the invention, a second unique multiple beam fringe sensor having a Fabry-Perot gap is disclosed that is also adapted to provide an accurate digital representation of a physical parameter (e.g. temperature) of a remote sample. The sensor may be fabricated in two segments. A fiber containing segment includes each of a driving optical fiber for supplying incident light signals to the Fabry-Perot gap and a sensing optical fiber for receiving output light signals that have been transmitted twice through the Fabry-Perot gap, the optical characteristics of which output signals provide an indication of the parameter to be sensed. A transducer segment includes the Fabry-Perot gap formed therein and means responsive to the physical parameter for changing the width of the Fabry-Perot gap and, accordingly, the optical characteristics of the light signals passing therethrough.", "keywords": ["coherent light", "light absorption", "light reflection", "light scattering", "light transmission"]}
