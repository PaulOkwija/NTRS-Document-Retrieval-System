{"id": 19990008606, "subjectCategory": "Optics", "title": "Integrated Fluorescence", "abstract": "A detection method is integrated with a filtering method and an enhancement method to create a fluorescence sensor that can be miniaturized. The fluorescence sensor comprises a thin film geometry including a waveguide layer, a metal film layer and sensor layer. The thin film geometry of the fluorescence sensor allows the detection of fluorescent radiation over a narrow wavelength interval. This enables wavelength discrimination and eliminates the detection of unwanted light from unknown or spurious sources.", "keywords": ["optical bistability", "optical coatings", "optical communications (theory)", "optical fibers", "optical imaging devices (theory)"]}
