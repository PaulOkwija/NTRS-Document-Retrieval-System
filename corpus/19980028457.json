{"id": 19980028457, "subjectCategory": "Optics", "title": "Polarization Independent Electro-Optic Modulator", "abstract": "A polarization insensitive electro-optic modulator is constructed by providing a polarization beamsplitter to separate an incoming light beam into two orthogonally plane polarized beams. Each of the polarized beams passes through a separate electro-optic modulator where each beam is modulated by the same data signal. After modulation the beams are combined to yield a modulated beam having modulated components that are orthogonally polarized. Not only is this device insensitive to changes in polarization of the input beam, the final modulated beam can be detected by optical receivers without regard to polarization alignment of the modulated beam and the receiver.", "keywords": ["coherent light", "light absorption", "light reflection", "light scattering", "light transmission"]}
