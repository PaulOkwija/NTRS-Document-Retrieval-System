    "abstract": "This report describes an analytical and experimental investigation of AeroVironment's Quasi-Bipolar battery concept. The modelling/battery design part of the study demonstrates that there is a trade-off between thermal and specified electrical performance. Even so, quasi-bipolar batteries can be designed, with ten times better thermal uniformity, that meet or exceed current state-of-the-art hybrid-electric vehicle battery pack performance, even using the same active materials. The thermal uniformity, power, and energy for these quasi-bipolar battery packs is projected to be very good. The experimental part of the investigation demonstrates the concept of the quasi-bipolar plate applied to a lead foil current collector wrapping around two sides of an inexpensive plastic film core. Approximately 50 quasi-biplate samples were fabricated using a hot laminating press. Hot lamination with \"texture\" between the plastic and lead shows some promise as a low cost method for fabricating the plates. Five of these plates were assembled into two cells plus one two-cell battery. Data from these test cells were compared with existing data for similar true bipolar batteries. The positive side of the plates exhibited corrosion where not protected by the active material."
